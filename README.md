# pandas_challenge

    This script analyzes data from schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv by merging into a dataframe.
A district summary, as well as analysis based on budget and other metrics seeks to find correlation
between factors that influence math and reading scores, as well as overall passing rate.

This script uses Pandas as pd to clean organize and summarize the analysis.
